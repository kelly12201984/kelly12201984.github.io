Welcome to my professional portfolio—where data meets design, and models meet meaning. This repository showcases a curated collection of real-world data science projects that span machine learning, visualization, ETL pipelines, and more. Every project was built with purpose: to solve complex problems, tell compelling stories, and show what’s possible when insight drives action.
